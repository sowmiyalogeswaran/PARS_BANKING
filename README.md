##Predictive Analytics and Recommendation Systems in Banking

## Overview
This project leverages advanced data science techniques to address three critical challenges faced by banks: predicting loan defaults, segmenting customers based on transaction behavior, and recommending suitable banking products. The objective is to enhance customer experience, reduce financial risks, and optimize product offerings.

## Problem Statement
Banks manage vast amounts of customer data and daily transactions. Analyzing this data effectively can:
1. Predict loan defaults to minimize financial risk.
2. Segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.
3. Recommend products to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Business Use Cases
### 1. Loan Default Prediction
- **Goal:** Identify customers likely to default on loans to refine loan approval processes and manage risks.
- **Approach:** Supervised learning using historical data.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
- **Goal:** Group customers based on transaction behavior to personalize marketing efforts.
- **Approach:** Unsupervised learning with clustering algorithms.

### 3. Product Recommendations
- **Goal:** Suggest relevant banking products to customers to enhance cross-selling opportunities.
- **Approach:** Build a recommendation engine using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.

## Methodology
### A. Supervised Learning: Loan Default Prediction
- **Data Source:** Historical loan data including demographics, credit scores, income, and repayment history.
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Steps:**
  1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, handling missing values).
  2. Feature engineering to create and refine attributes.
  3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
  4. Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### B. Unsupervised Learning: Customer Segmentation
- **Data Source:** Transactional data (frequency, amount, type).
- **Algorithm:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Steps:**
  1. Standardize data and select relevant features.
  2. Apply clustering algorithms.
  3. Analyze clusters using visualizations (e.g., PCA).

### C. Recommendation Engine: Product Recommendations
- **Data Source:** Customer interaction data (e.g., purchases, views).
- **Algorithm:** Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Content-Based Filtering.
- **Steps:**
  1. Handle sparsity in customer-product matrix.
  2. Build and evaluate recommendation models.
  3. Generate personalized product suggestions.

## Results
- **Loan Default Prediction:** A model that accurately predicts loan defaults, aiding in risk mitigation.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segments enabling personalized marketing strategies and product development.
- **Product Recommendations:** Tailored product suggestions to improve customer experience and loyalty.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Supervised Learning:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Cluster Visualizations.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Precision, Recall, MAP, NDCG.

## Synthetic Dataset
### Loan Default Prediction
1. `customer_id`: Unique identifier.
2. `age`: Customer age.
3. `income`: Annual income.
4. `credit_score`: Credit score.
5. `loan_amount`: Loan amount.
6. `interest_rate`: Interest rate.
7. `loan_term`: Loan term (months).
8. `repayment_status`: Binary indicator (1 = default, 0 = no default).

### Customer Segmentation
1. `customer_id`: Unique identifier.
2. `transaction_id`: Transaction identifier.
3. `transaction_amount`: Transaction value.
4. `transaction_type`: Type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal).
5. `transaction_date`: Transaction date.

### Recommendation Engine
1. `customer_id`: Unique identifier.
2. `product_id`: Product identifier.
3. `interaction_type`: Interaction type (e.g., purchased, viewed).
4. `interaction_date`: Interaction date.

## Dataset Creation
- Synthetic datasets are generated using Python libraries like Faker.
- Feature engineering is applied to enrich data quality and relevance.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the scripts for each module: loan prediction, segmentation, and recommendations.
